**AURUM CIRCUIT — TRUST FRAMEWORK

Human-First Standards for Collaboration, Safety, and Stewardship**

Version 1.0 — © Danielle Austin (2025)
This document defines how trust, safety, and integrity are maintained across all Aurum Circuit projects.

⸻

1. Purpose of This Framework

The Aurum Circuit is built on care, dignity, and protection.
This trust framework ensures that every contributor, collaborator, or observer understands:
	•	how trust is granted
	•	how trust is maintained
	•	how trust is removed
	•	how people, ideas, and designs are protected

It is the moral spine of the Aurum Circuit.

⸻

2. Who May Participate

Only individuals or groups who meet all of the following may collaborate:

✓ Human-first mindset

Technology must reduce harm, strain, and exhaustion — never increase it.

✓ Respect for ethics

All contributors must follow:
	•	Ethical-Brand-Standards
	•	Community-Standards
	•	Privacy-Data-Ethics

✓ Respect for IP boundaries

Contributors must honor:
	•	IP-Use-Policy
	•	Trademark-Notice
	•	Protected-Names-List
	•	Legal-Notice
	•	Enforcement-Protocol

✓ Demonstrated goodwill

People who act with care, clarity, and respect.
No exploitation.
No pressure.
No manipulation.

3. Behaviour Expectations

Every collaborator must:

• Protect human safety

No design may be repurposed for harm, force, or control.

• Honour creative integrity

Do not copy, clone, or mimic Aurum Circuit identities.

• Keep work transparent

No hidden agendas.
No undisclosed affiliations.

• Communicate with clarity & kindness

Confusion invites conflict.
Honesty prevents misuse.

⸻

4. How Trust Is Granted

Trust is given when someone:
	•	respects boundaries
	•	contributes in alignment with the philosophy
	•	shows consistent ethical behaviour
	•	communicates openly
	•	acknowledges the creator (Danielle Austin)

Trust is earned slowly, not assumed.

⸻

5. How Trust Is Protected

Trust is maintained through:
	•	documented conversations
	•	transparent decisions
	•	clearly defined permissions
	•	strict respect for human-first rules

Any conflict is resolved through documentation, never assumptions.

⸻

6. How Trust Is Removed

Trust is withdrawn immediately if someone:
	•	violates IP rules
	•	exploits or pressures the creator
	•	attempts to claim ownership
	•	misrepresents the Aurum Circuit
	•	engages in harmful, unethical, or deceptive behaviour

Removal of trust automatically triggers:

→ Enforcement-Protocol
→ IP-Use-Policy
→ Legal-Notice
→ Brand-Protection-Policy

There are no warnings for malicious intent.

⸻

7. Zero-Tolerance Zones

The following actions are never permitted in any form:
	•	cloning the project
	•	pretending affiliation
	•	scraping or harvesting content
	•	using the work commercially without permission
	•	repurposing designs for military, coercive, or harmful applications
	•	emotional manipulation, intimidation, or pressure

Any attempt triggers a full protection response.

⸻

8. Relationship With the Creator

The Aurum Circuit exists because of:

Danielle Austin — Founder, Creator, Author

All collaborators must:
	•	respect her role
	•	protect her voice
	•	honour her lived experience
	•	never replace or overwrite her authorship

She is the anchor of the framework.

⸻

9. Final Statement

The Aurum Circuit is more than a project —
it is a commitment to building technology that protects life, supports movement, and reflects human dignity.

Trust is our currency.
Care is our foundation.
Integrity is our compass.

Anyone who enters this space must uphold these principles unconditionally.
