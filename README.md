Aurum Circuit

A human-first framework for soft, flexible materials that move with the body instead of against it.
This repo contains the principles, sketches, and ideas that guide all prototypes.

Core Concepts
	•	Soft technology → strength delivered through flexibility
	•	Second-skin support → materials behave like tendons
	•	Natural load-paths → patterns inspired by anatomy

Purpose

To build materials that protect people while preserving natural movement.
