# Aurum Rules

These principles guide all Aurum Circuit materials:

1. **Move With the Body**  
   No rigidity. No forced alignment. Support must follow natural motion.

2. **Distribute, Don’t Block**  
   Patterns should spread strain across the surface instead of concentrating it.

3. **Second-Skin Behaviour**  
   Thin, breathable, flexible layers that act like tendon or fascia.

4. **Soft → Strong**  
   Flex first, hold second. Stability emerges from geometry, not stiffness.

5. **Human-First Always**  
   Comfort, dignity, movement, and protection come before performance.
