# Soft Technology

Soft technology is strength delivered through flexibility.

A material qualifies as "Aurum" when:
1. It feels gentle against the body.
2. It distributes load naturally without resisting movement.
3. It stabilises through pattern, not rigidity.
4. It functions like biological reinforcement: tendons, fascia, spirals, meshes.

The Aurum Circuit is built on this principle.
